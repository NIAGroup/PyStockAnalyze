# PyStockAnalyze
Django web application that takes stock data, analyzes it and presents a graphical user interface.

Note: If you're using a Linux/Mac OS, skip to step 5 and assume that all steps applying to Git Bash apply to the native Terminal

## Environment Setup
1. Install Python 3.7.2 (Check off "Add Python 3.7 to PATH")
   > https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/
2. Install a code editor
   1. Option 1: PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)
   2. Option 2: Sublime (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
   > Note: Make sure your editor is on your windows path or save the path in notepad (to be used in a later step)
3. Install Git Bash:
   > https://git-scm.com/downloads
4. While inside of the git bash commandline, modify proxy to support github access by executing
   > ```git config --global http.proxy http://<proxy_server>:<port>```
   
   > Note: Git bash will be used to make updates to the repository and submit them to the remote repository
5. Open Git Bash and navigate to home directory to create .bashrc file
   > Navigate to home directory by entering ```cd ~```
   
   > ```touch ~/.bashrc```
   
   > To check that this file exists, run ```ls ~/.bashrc```

   > Add the following code to the bashrc file
   ```bash
   # Enable calling python executable
   alias python='winpty python.exe'
   
   # Add support to open editors from git bash commandline with ```$ <editor_name> <file>```
   alias pycharm='winpty pycharm.exe'
   alias sublime='winpty C:/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 3/sublime_text.exe'
   alias atom='winpty C:/Users/<user_name>/AppData/Local/atom/atom.exe'
   
   # Setup proxy
   PROXY_OPT=--proxy=http://<proxy_server>:<port>
   # Enable building environment through command
   alias buildenv='source $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/tools/build_env.sh'
   alias cleanenv='$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/tools/clean_env.sh'
   alias setproxy='PROXY_OPT=--proxy=http://<proxy_sever>:<port>'
   alias clrproxy='PROXY_OPT='
   ```
   > Copy the proxy info into your bash RC file on the lines containing
   
   > Make sure to update the PROXY in the bashrc with the correct proxy information behind the firewall
   
   > Note if you're adding the alias links for pycharm/sublime/atom/notepad++ to make sure to specify in Linux style (directories separated by /, and not \, the latter being Windows style)

5. Clone repository:
   > Inside of your terminal/git bash, navigate to the folder in which you want to download your repository
   
   > Execute ```git clone https://github.com/NIAGroup/PyStockAnalyze.git```

6. Exit Git Bash and re-open it or run "source ~/.bashrc" to make the new commands available for execution while in git bash. The commands are to be used as follows:
   > **buildenv** - Used to create the python virtual environment and install all dependencies (Make sure to cd into the cloned repository before running this command)

   > **cleanenv** - Used to remove virtual environment build folder and exit environment if it's active (Make sure to cd into the cloned repository before running this command)

7. To activate the virtual environment type in the following command:
   
   activate

8. Add the line below to the following file : localuser.py **above the Database passwords declarations**

   django_production_key='123'

   NOTE: The file can be found in the following directory:
   ```
   pystockanalyze-2019/src/pysdjango/pysdjango/localenv/localuser.py
   ```
9. Enable git flow:
   ```bash
   cd <repo_path>
   git flow init
   ```

10. Test that the build flow worked by running django webserver:
   ```bash
   manage runserver
   ```
   > Open web browser to the following URL: ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/```
