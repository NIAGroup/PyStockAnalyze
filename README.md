# PyStockAnalyze
Django web application that takes stock data, analyzes it and presents a graphical user interface.

## Environment Setup
1. Install Python 3.7.2 (Check off "Add Python 3.7 to PATH")
   > https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/
2. Install Git Bash:
   > https://git-scm.com/downloads
3. Open Git Bash and navigate to home directory to create .bashrc file
   ```touch ~/.bashrc```

   Add the following code to the bashrc file
   ```bash
   # Enable calling python executable
   alias python='winpty python.exe'

   # Enable building environment through command
   alias buildenv='source $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/tools/build_env.sh'
   alias cleanenv='$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/tools/clean_env.sh'

   PROXY_OPT=--proxy=http://proxy-us.intel.com:911
   ```

4. Exit Git Bash and re-open it or run "source ~/.bashrc" to make the new commands available for execution while in git bash. The commands are to be used as follows:
   * buildenv - Used to create the python virtual environment and install all dependencies
   * cleanenv - Used to remove virtual environment build folder and exit environment if it's active

5. Clone repository:
   ```git clone https://github.com/NIAGroup/PyStockAnalyze.git```
